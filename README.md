# My Simple Calculator Project

## Description

This is a simple calculator project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). It is a hands-on project aimed at strengthening my understanding of JavaScript DOM manipulation and function logic.

## Goal and Skills

The goal of this project is to build a functioning calculator with a user interface that includes number and operator buttons, a display section, and clear/equal functionality. This project helps me apply everything Iâ€™ve learned so far in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Skills Demonstrated

- Creating and linking HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files  
- Creating interactive buttons and input fields  
- Using JavaScript functions and event listeners  
- Handling arithmetic logic without using `eval()`  
- Working with variables, arrays, and control flow  
- Practicing object-oriented thinking (via modular code structure)  
- Using Flexbox for layout alignment  
- Using custom CSS styles to improve UI appearance  
- Publishing the calculator project online via GitHub Pages
